These fields must be input in the order shown above, where <types> is a set of letters, and the others are single numbers defining the range of computation.

The <types> field consists of zero or more of the letters from the set <stcdr>, which indicate respectively,

(1) The desired trig functions: sin, tan, cos.
(2) Whether to use degrees or radians for input parameters.
